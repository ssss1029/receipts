# receipts

This is a test application that is meant to be a proof of concept for a future app that reads and processes receipts. 

// Currently in the works 

To run the server:

```
npm install
node serve
```

You can also use nodemon to run the server, but ignoring the uploads directory

```
nodemon serve --ignore uploads
```
